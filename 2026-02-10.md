## Notes


### Basics
More important to write code that is understandable by other developers than difficult, confusing 
- Make sure other developers can understand your code

No duplication
- Dont repeat yourself
- If you change your code, you would have to change it in a lot of places.

A solution is a container that organizes one or more projects
- Each solution represents something different (an application/library/ or service)
- Solutions are used ot manage mutliple related projects together

Service Defaults is the default services that are registered in the application
- Consistency across the application

What is async Task<Ok>? 

### Technical information

* TCP is a two way connection
    - Triple handshake


* .NET Creates Assemblies



* Services
    - Code or Code Thingies that own some data and all the process around that data





## Features (abbreviated):
- students: (YOU)
    - add MM - the collection of your MM
    - edit an MM - you can edit one of your MM, but not someone elses
    - remove an MM - you can remove one of yours, but not someone elses
    - see all of their MM - you can see your list, but not anyone elses
- instructor
    - see the aggregated list - I can see al of them, but I don't know who created each one
    - punt - I have my own list, basically, that I can put things on to defer them to later

### Storing
- Documents
    - /emloyees/x99999

- Collections
    - /employees

```http
POST https://localhost:7059/students/[student id]/moments
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer ???? (Fake this for a while)
{
    "title": "HTTP",
    "description": "This is a description"
}
```


## Three Designs Features

In a project we have three things we can 'design', and we have to figure out how to map a business process to these three things


1. Resources
    - An important thing we want to expose to the consumer of this service. They have names. At least one. And those are URIs.
    - https://mm.hypertheory-labs.dev/api/students/moments
        - the scheme - http | https
        - "mm.hypertheory-labs.dev" - known as the "origin" or sometimes the "authority".
        - /api/student/moments - "the path" (to the thing we want, the resource)

2. Representations
    - what are you going to get from a resource, or send to a resource?
    - the web doesn't specify. Can be ANYTHING the client and the server agree on.
    - we are going to do our representations in JSON (a serialization format)

3. Methods
    - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    - GET means "get" - I wanna see it. No "side effects"
    - POST means different things depending on the kind of resource - but on a "collection" resource it means something like:   
        - "Excuse me ma'am, I'd like you to consider taking this representation I am sending you and making part of your family"


## Our Project
### External

We should be able to do the following

Add MM
- Add 1-3 MMs to be explored the next day
- Title (Developer Testing)
- Description (optional, more context for what you're looking for)

Get a list of MM
- A student needs a way to see the list of all their submitted MMs

Remove an MM

Edit an MM

Instructor

Get A List
- Can get a list of all the students aggregated moments in a summary form so they can be addressed

Punt
- Say "I don't want to lose this, but I promise I'll talk about it later"



### Internal

AppHost
- This is just for development
- Has access to MM.api and Gateway.api

MM.api
- An api 
- Has access to ServiceDefaults

Gateway.api
- An api 
- Has access to ServiceDefaults

ServiceDefaults
- Default services used across the solution
