3 True or _False_: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.

5 What is a solution in .NET?
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things
6 What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.
7 What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?

    -2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)
    -3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)
8 What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?

# Layers

* Application
* Transport (TCP/UDP)
    * TCP - "Connection Oriented"
    * UDP - "Connectionless" - notifications
* IP
    * Routing - How one computer can send messages to another
    * Big innovation at the time - routes around damage
* Wifi/Wired Ethernet


# 
HTTPS require(dls)
* getting a certificate from a certificate authority
* they allow you to encrypt communication and ALSO verified identity
* You can still do that, because it is important

ACME
* Lets encrypt, etc.
* Free and easy to use
HTTP - asymetric encyption
#


Web forms sucked in 2016, Replaced with ASP.NET MVC
- Much closer to the metal
- You had to know HTML, but that gave you more power


#

**Code calling outside of our API project MUST use async/await**

Garbage collector
- non-halting
- generational (smart)


Startup time isn't a huge deal for some apps if the timing is relatively low
- If it takes a second more then it isn't that big of a deal because it will be running for days

Native
- There is a start up time
On demand APIs
- "Serverless"
- Ran on demand (amazon lambda, azure function, etc.)



#

Need to worry about authority when coding
- Who can do what, permissions for each person, etc.
