# Quiz

1 When you compile a .NET project, it produces an _assembly_, which is a combination of metadata about the types produced, and the _IL_ (_intermediate language_) that the .NET Runtime (CLR) executes.
2 The major difference between ".NET Core" and what we now call ".NET Framework" is:
    - Core is cross platform and open source, Framework is windows only
3 True or _False_: .NET is commercial software and you must pay a license to Microsoft to develop code using .NET.
4 True or _False_: .NET code must be created using Microsoft Visual Studio, though a free version is available.
5 What is a solution in .NET?
    - A glorified folder, holds projects. Holds configuration things
6 What is the purpose of Aspire? At least as far as we are using it.
    - Distributed Application Development. Helps us run and deploy the different applications we have in one nice place.
7 What are the three main things we design when designing an HTTP API?
    -1). Resources (endpoints).
    -2). Methods (actions, ie GET POST PUT DELETE)
    -3). Formats/Representations (req/res structures)
8 What is meant by the term "Service" as we are using it in our development?
    -  Code that owns some data and all processes around that data
9 What is the difference between using the HTTP protocol scheme and the HTTPS protocol scheme?
    - The s, or the encrypted later between server/client communication
10 What is a "port" in TCP networking?
    - Port where TCP is listening to incoming requests



# Layers

* Application
* Transport (TCP/UDP)
    * TCP - "Connection Oriented"
    * UDP - "Connectionless" - notifications
* IP
    * Routing - How one computer can send messages to another
    * Big innovation at the time - routes around damage
* Wifi/Wired Ethernet


# 
HTTPS require(dls)
* getting a certificate from a certificate authority
* they allow you to encrypt communication and ALSO verified identity
* You can still do that, because it is important

ACME
* Lets encrypt, etc.
* Free and easy to use
HTTP 
* asymetric encyption


Web forms sucked in 2016, Replaced with ASP.NET MVC
- Much closer to the metal
- You had to know HTML, but that gave you more power


# Databases/External calls

**Code calling outside of our API project MUST use async/await**

To connect to a database we would need
1. Info to connect to a database (server/credentials)
    * ConnectionStrings
    * Configuation (part of our app that changes by environemnt)
2. Open a Connection
    * some library/package specific for that database
    * EntityFramework
        * relational database
    * lighter
    * NoSql means database is not going to enforce rules about data consistence
3. Run a Query, wait for results or Run a command
4. Close Connection
5. Process results, send response, etc.


#
Garbage collector
- non-halting
- generational (smart)


Startup time isn't a huge deal for some apps if the timing is relatively low
- If it takes a second more then it isn't that big of a deal because it will be running for days

Native
- There is a start up time
On demand APIs
- "Serverless"
- Ran on demand (amazon lambda, azure function, etc.)



#

Need to worry about authority when coding
- Who can do what, permissions for each person, etc.
