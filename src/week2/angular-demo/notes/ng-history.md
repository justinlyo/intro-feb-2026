# Angular 2

- The router stunk. It was a mess.

The AngularJS router stunk, too. Turns out routers are hard.

There was a "community" router for AngularJS that everyone used instead.

We were on Angular 2.0.0 - Angular Router 3.0.0

## Forms

- Template Driven Forms - there from day 1 - you just put a lot of junk in your template (.html) file
- Reactive Forms - way more code - VERY observable dependent. Too much so.
- Signal Based Forms - Still experimental, probably out as "stable" this summer.
  - I love this as much as a man could or should love a forms library.
