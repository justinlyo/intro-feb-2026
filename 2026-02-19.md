# Thursday

- Code Sync?


## QueueAndA

You can submit an "open question" - like "Anyone have any good links for resolving NPM conflicts?" or "What issues have you run into upgrading to Angular 21.2?"

Other users (uh, you, probably) will be able to submit answers.

### Additional Possible Features

The creator of the question can select an answer as "THIS" meaning it is the correct answer. After this happens, the question is removed from the list of "open questions" and placed into "answered questions", and the selected answer is highlighted
with other answer submitted hidden, but being available to see if you want.
