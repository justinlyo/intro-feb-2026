Unit Tests are tests that test a "unit" of code in isolation for other dependencies that change so frequently, they may "break" your test

Our tests inside a pipeline cannot talk to any other services, apis, databases, IDPs, etc. outside of the pipeline. It should only test our teams code


#

System Integration (End to End) tets TEND to be "black box tests"

Unit Tests and Unit Integration tests are "white box tests"
