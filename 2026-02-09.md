# 2026-02-09

How to end the day:
1. "Muddiest Moment" - At the end of each day look at your notes and identify at least one of the things that is the opposite of #1 below. (something i want to learn more about). Something before we leave for the day.

How to start the day:
2. Every morning after today we will start asking a random selection of this question:
- What do you remember that was helpful from yesterday?
- What was cool and you want to know more about?

### Notes

I want to learn more about the different markdown notation

Exaclidraw - Great tool for organizing my thoughts

ASP.NET Core Web Api

What's a solution in Visual Studio?
Want to learn more about microservices

Extension: 'Diff Folders' shows the difference between two different folders and will allow you to pull in specified changes. Good for keeping up to date

In a perfect development world, everyone would be pushing to the main repo
Fetch changes in repo daily and push your work daily. 
- Get the latest changes as often as you can
- Dont let code sit on your machine

Structure of applications matter a lot
- No two developers should have an excuse to work on the same file at the same time
- Applications tend to have a lot of small files to avoid two developers working on one script
- Organizing code around business features instead of technical concerns

Storing binaries & dependencies WAS a good practice, but it isn't so good anymore

Everything is continuously changing and it is our job to not only adapt to these changes, but also welcome it

Production - the only environment that counts
Development -> Test/Shipping -> Production
Best Practices
- If you can replicate as closely as possible the production environment in every environment, you'll have less production issues
- The less your app relies on, the better. Take as few dependencies as possible

Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Developer testing is important!

Containers (Docker) let us run software that:
- Won't break other things on your machine (protective containers)
- And match what we have in other environments (dev/prod parity)


A project is like a jar
A solution is like a workspace


### Version Control
TFS - Team Foundation Server (Version control from Microsoft)

#### Github

what we should store
- source code

what we shouldn't store
- libraries we use (dlls)
- other teams code
- images (careful)
